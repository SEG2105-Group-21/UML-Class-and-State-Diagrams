# UML-Class-and-State-Diagrams

Utilized the object-oriented modelling tool, Umple, to create UML class diagrams and UML state machine diagrams for a hypothetical ticketing system.

*NOTE: The code ressembles Java code, but is not Java code. This is Umple code and can only be used on https://cruise.umple.org/umpleonline/ to generate UML diagrams.*

## System Description

Design a system that will allow individuals to book concert
tickets. The system supports two types of users: artists and customers. All
users are identified by their name, email, and phone number.
In order to schedule a tour and performances, the artist user must be verified.
Once verified, the artist schedules a tour. The tour consists of many different
performances. These performances occur at various dates and times across
different venues. A venue has a name, address, city, and capacity limit.
A customer wishing to buy tickets to a performance must have a credit card
number. To create an order, the customer selects an artist, then they select a
performance they wish to attend, and finally they choose a seat. Tickets are
held for 10 minutes while the customer enters their payment information. A
customer can book a ticket for themselves or they can book many tickets for a
performance at once for their family/friends. The system limits the amount of
tickets the customer can book per performance to 6 tickets. After purchasing,
a customer can choose to resell a ticket using the system or request an
exchange. Naturally, the customer can have many bookings for different
performances from different artists.
